# Meme Generator

Create your own meme by generating a classic meme format and adding your own top and bottom text. This app was inspired by Project #3 of [Bob Ziroll's](https://github.com/bobziroll) <a href="https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact">Learn React for free</a> course on Scrimba.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
